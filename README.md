##  Generate DC2 Requirements

Summary -- A document that maps the different data challenges into detailed simulation requirements with
regard to simulation methodology, cosmological physics, fidelity, volume, mass resolution, and properties of
the mock catalogs.

### Key Tasks
* Key Task CS3.1.1 ( 06/16 ): Collect requirements from working groups for each data challenge. This will
necessarily be an iterative process.
* Key Task CS3.1.2 ( 12/16 ): Prepare a document outlining all the requirements and the plan for delivering the
requirements.

#### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
